## Problem 1

### Import and clean data

```{r}
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved"
    )
  ) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa, AL") 

```

> The cleaned data frame has 52178 observations in uid, reported_date, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex, city, state, lat, lon, disposition, city_state, resolution variables.

### Proportion of homicides unsolved in the city of Baltimore

```{r}
# Filter the dataset
baltimore_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  select(city_state, disposition, resolution) %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolution == "unsolved"))

# Proportion test
baltimore_test = 
  prop.test(
    x = baltimore_df %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
    n = baltimore_df %>% pull(hom_total))

broom::tidy(baltimore_test) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```
